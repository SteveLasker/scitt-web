# Claims & Endorsement Specification

> TODO: 
> - Why a spec for a claim is important, enabling query capabilities
> - Delta of a claim vs. evidence
> - Assumed it's the content of the COSE payload
> - Discussion for known claim values, likely with namespaces, enabling consumers to identify if a product is good for production, vs build, energy vs. gaming, financial vs. government, high security vs. critical security
> - Why simple name/value pairs are too simple
> - Why SBOM/in-toto formats are perfect for evidence types, but too complex to be the format for the claims placed on the ledger
