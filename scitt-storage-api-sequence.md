# SCITT API Sequence/Workflow

>TODO: Cover the API workflow for how:
> - Evidence is submitted
> - Detached signatures of the evidence is submitted, and related to the evidence
> - Claims are submitted, with a detached signature
> - How both are related to a parent object, (the `net-monitor:v1` image), which wasn't saved through the SCITT ledger APIs.

Both claims and evidence are optional
